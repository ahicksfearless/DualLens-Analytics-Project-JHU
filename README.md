# Hopkins DualLens Analytics Project
In the rapidly evolving world of finance and technology, I help investors make smarter decisions by combining traditional financial analysis with emerging technological insights. While stock market trends provide a numerical perspective on growth, an organization's initiatives in cutting-edge fields like Artificial Intelligence (AI) reveal its future readiness and innovation potential. However, analyzing both dimensions - quantitative financial performance and qualitative AI initiatives - requires sifting through multiple, diverse data sources: stock data from platforms like Yahoo Finance, reports in PDFs, and contextual reasoning using Large Language Models (LLMs).

This is where I built DualLens Analytics. By applying a dual-lens approach, I leveraged Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to merge financial growth data with strategic insights from organizational reports. Stock data provides evidence of stability and momentum, while AI initiative documents reveal forward-looking innovation. Together, they form a richer, more holistic picture of organizational potential.

Through DualLens Analytics, I enable investors to move beyond choosing between numbers and narratives—they gain a unified, AI-driven perspective that ranks organizations by both financial strength and innovation readiness, enabling smarter, future-focused investment strategies.

Traditional investment analysis often focuses on financial metrics alone (e.g., stock growth, revenue, market cap), missing the qualitative dimension of how prepared a company is for the future. On the other hand, qualitative documents like strategy PDFs contain valuable insights about innovation and AI initiatives, but they are difficult to structure, query, and integrate with numeric financial data.

This leads to three core challenges I identified:

1. Fragmented Data Sources: Financial data (stock prices) and strategic insights (PDFs) exist in silos.
2. Limited Analytical Scope: Manual analysis of growth trends and PDF reports is time-consuming and error-prone.
3. Decisional Blind Spots: Without integrating both quantitative (growth trends) and qualitative (AI initiatives) signals, investors may miss out on high-potential organizations.

To address this challenge, I built a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) powered system that blends financial trends with AI-related strategic insights, helping investors rank organizations based on growth trajectory and innovation capacity.
